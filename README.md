# Cleaning and Manipulating Data Features for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Getting Started

Download this repo from github. Execute run_analysis.R with below prerequisites. 

### Prerequisites

To run this script you would need R Client tools and Rstudio. 
Download the data either from repo or from below link:

For more details on data use readme.txt in the downloaded dataset. 

## Script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
